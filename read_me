I honestly bit off more than i could chew with only the lectures and 2 labs in 448 of javascript. I spent much time and just kept breaking parts of victory detection. I spent even
more hours trying to get the bugs out but i am exausted, and i think i just have to call it. Know that the project may not work right, but it wasnt from lack of trying.
